In order to better align with equals signs and stuff, it is better
to have fractions span three lines (as opposed to two lines with the
top one being underlined).

The bar character "―" (U+2015) was chosen.

The length of the bar is the maximum of the lengths of the numerator
and denominator padded with two more characters on the end.

  ―――― = 3.14
    7

Ideally, we want to align the expressions, but this is not always possible. In
this case, while we can align the longer expression (because that determines the
length of the bar), the smaller expression may not align if its length mod 2 is
not congruent to the longer expression length mod 2.

  x / 2         x            x
 ――――――― = ――――――――――― = ――――――――
  x - 2     2 (x - 2)     2x - 4

If the numerator or denominator has a trivial division, similar to the one seen above,
it is easier to render it linearly.

In some cases, such as numeral multiplication, we are able to add a space in order
to center the expression cleanly. If possible, do so.

   x           x + 8
  ――― + 4     ―――――――
   2             2        x + 8
 ――――――――― = ――――――――― = ―――――――
     x           x         2x

                           ^
                           It actually looks fine when the 2x is aligned more to the
                           right, but in the number uneven denominator, it looked a
                           bit weirder. How should we choose? Perhaps if they are
                           uneven, take the length of the bar and divide it by 2? It
                           seems to work?

Fractions in fractions are rendered as you might expect.
