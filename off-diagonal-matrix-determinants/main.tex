\section*{Determinants of Off-Diagonal Triangular Matrices}

Consider a matrix of the following consisting of only nonzero elements on the diagonal and off-diagonal:
\[
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} \\
        a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
        & a_{32} & \ddots & a_{(n-2)(n-1)} \\
        & & & a_{(n-1)(n-1)} & a_{(n-1)n} \\
        & & & a_{n(n-1)} & a_{nn}
    \end{bmatrix}
.\]

\begin{blackbox}
    \begin{problem}
        What is the determinant of \( A \)?
    \end{problem}
\end{blackbox}

\begin{solution}
    We will derive a recurrence for the diagonal elements \( d_i \) after having row reduced to eliminate the values below the diagonal. Following this row reduction, the determinant will simply be
    \[
        \det A = d_1 d_2 \cdots d_n
    .\]
    Our initial condition shall be that \( d_1 = a_11 \). Observe then that
    \[
        d_i = a_{ii} - a_{i(i-1)} \cdot \frac{a_{(i-1)i}}{d_{i-1}}
    ,\]
    which suffices for our recurrence.

    If one of the \( d_i \) values are \( 0 \), then the determinant doesn't exist (?). Actually this isn't true hmmmm I suppose we could row swap up in this case.
\end{solution}
