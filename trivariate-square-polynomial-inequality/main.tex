\section*{A Small Little Three Variable Inequality}

% Actually I just wanted to type this out for a friend but hey might as well keep it right

\begin{chirpbox}
    \begin{problem}
        For real numbers \( a, b, c \) such that \( a \le b \le c \), prove that
        \[
            a^2 + ac + c^2 \ge 3b (a - b + c)
        .\]
    \end{problem}
\end{chirpbox}

\begin{proof}
Bring everything over to one side. We must prove that
\[
    a^2 + c^2 + 3b^2 + ac - 3bc - 3ab \ge 0
.\]
From the trivial inequality, one has that \( (b - a)^2 = b^2 - 2ab + a^2 \ge 0 \) and also \( (c - b)^2 = c^2 - 2bc + b^2 \ge 0 \). Substituting these into the inequality we get that
\[
    (b - a)^2 + (c - b)^2 - bc + b^2 - ab + ac \ge 0
.\]
From here we can factor a little bit. Notice that \( -bc + b^2 = - b(c - b) \) and \( -ab + ac = a(c - b) \). Adding these we get that \( -bc + b^2 - ab + ac = (a - b)(c - b) = -(b - a)(c - b) \), so
\[
    (b - a)^2 + (c-b)^2 \ge (b - a)(c - b)
.\]
But this follows directly from AM-GM, where we have
\[
    (b - a)^2 + (c - b)^2 \ge 2 \sqrt{(b - a)^2 (c - b)^2} = 2 (b-a)(c - b)
.\]
\end{proof}

One must remark that the inequality in the problem actually isn't needed, which
is rather odd.
